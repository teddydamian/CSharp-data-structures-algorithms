# FizzBuzz Tree
### Author: Teddy Damian

## Problem Domain
Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both.
Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
- If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
- If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
- If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
- If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
- Return the new tree.
