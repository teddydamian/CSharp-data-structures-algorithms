# Breadth Traversal
### Author: Teddy Damian

## Problem Domain
Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach, and return a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered.

## Input 
![Tree](https://github.com/teddydamian/CSharp-data-structures-algorithms/blob/master/assets/binary-tree.png)
## Output

[2,7,5,2,6,9,5,11,4]
```
